All pages created should be paired with their own GIST at gist.github.com, and a markdown file created with the GIST id. Every individual code sample should get its own file with the proper language extension, and committed to master. A GIST at gist.github.com will be used and the embed script option will allow you to enbed the GIST in a paired HTML page. 
For example, if you have a code file called sendEnvelope.cs, you should check that in to master, then create a GIST for that snippet. Copy the embed HTML script tag from the GIST github interface, and then create a paired HTML page for sendEnvelope.html Place in the body tag the script tag, and in the title tag put the name of your snippet using spaces to separate words.
